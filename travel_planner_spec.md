}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Component Architecture
- Modular React components for reusability
- Shared components: Button, Card, Input, Tag, ProgressBar
- Screen-specific components: PreferenceSelector, ActivityCard, ItineraryDay
- Custom hooks for animations and state management

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for images
- Optimized animations (use transform/opacity)
- Efficient re-renders with React.memo where appropriate
- Mock data loading with realistic delays

### Demo Flow Control
- Linear progression through screens
- Ability to go back and modify selections
- Mock data responses based on user selections
- Simulated processing delays for realism

## Success Metrics for Demo
- **Visual Impact**: "Wow factor" on itinerary reveal
- **Smooth User Experience**: No janky animations or slow transitions
- **Personalization Clarity**: Clear connection between preferences and recommendations
- **Professional Polish**: Production-ready visual quality
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users can complete flow without instruction

## Deliverables
